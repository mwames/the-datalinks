    "description": "Matter Editation (B16) and Secrets of Alpha Centauri (D12) point the way to one of the most celebrated concepts in science fiction -- Matter Transmission. Transmitters based on this technology disassemble objects into the smallest component sub-particles, then transmit those particles and their underlying structural blueprint to a receiver. The receiver reassembles these objects according to the blueprint, recreating the original in every nuance and detail."
