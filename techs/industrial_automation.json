Exploitation of Planet's resources under such brutal conditions has required quantum advances in robotic and teleoperational technology.",

    "description": "The creation of Planetary Networks (D2) and widespread adoption of Industrial Economics (B2) lead to rapid industrializations of the virgin Planet. Lacking the traditional masses of Earth's working class, leaders must now develop complete Industrial Automation for production and assembly, building modest factories where all repetitive nonskilled jobs, from janitor to VP of Sales, are handled by sophisticated robotics."
