But what I cannot shake, and what hints at things to come, is that thoughts cross back. In my dreams, the sensibility of the machine invades the periphery of my conciousness: dark, rigid, cold, alien. Evolution is at work here, but just what is evolving remains to be seen.",

    "description": "The insatiable drive for efficiency spawned by Industrial Automation (B3) drives the development of Neural Grafting. This new technology, based on Secrets of the Human Brain (D2), allows attachments of digital circuitry directly to the neural cortex. With these implants individuals willing to undergo Neural Grafting can enhance many aspects of their physical being, from heightened senses to faster reaction times."
