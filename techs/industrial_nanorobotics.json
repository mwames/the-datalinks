    "description": "The business leaders of Planet quickly perceived the commercial potential of Nanominiturization (B8), and constructed factories based around Industrial Nanorobotics. These factories utilize traditional Industrial Automation (B3), but at a fraction of the size and cost. Productivity skyrockets along with profitability, as tiny robots churn out new products for consumption."
