Then, take your result, square it, and feed it back to your original function, adding a new set of sense data. Continue to feed your results back into the original function ad infinitum. What do you have? The fundamental principle of human conciousness.",

These open-ended neural net programs can sort and process exebytes of data, 'learning' as they do so and adapting to the world they observe."
