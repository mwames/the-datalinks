    "description": "Machines with moving parts have long been subject to wear and tear as the parts grind against one another. On Earth, traditional lubricants such as oil were used to minimize these effects. Planet lacks large reserves of such materials, until the invention of Synthetic Fossil Fuels (E4). With Organic Superlubricant, scientists can create lubricating compounds that act like simple life forms, seeking out areas where they do the most good."
