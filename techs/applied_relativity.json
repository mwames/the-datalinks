    "description": "Albert Einstein developed his theories of relativity between 1905 and 1916; complete explanations of his work may be found in a number of sources. Later research into Advanced Subatomic Theories (B3) and Superconductors (C4) demonstrated that his postulates, though innovative for his time, were incomplete. Applied Relativity takes Einstein's basic theories and updates them to encompass an understanding of newly-discovered phenomena."
