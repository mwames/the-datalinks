What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end: what can be loved in man is that he is an overture and a going under. I love those who do not know how to live, for they are those who cross over.",

    "description": "Following the development of Homo Superior (E7), many advocated a return to Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy of The Will to Power. The philosophy stresses the importance of strength, asceticism, and resolut action, often at the cost of compassion, charity, and other traditionally religious qualities."
