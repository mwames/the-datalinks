We now teach the software how to learn, and in the primary bonding process it molds itself around the task to be performed. The feedback loop never really ends, so a tenth year polysentience can be a priceless jewel or a psychotic wreck, but it is the primary bonding -- the childhood, if you will -- that has the most far-reaching repercussions.",

These new artificial intelligences have all the hallmarks of an individual organism: they respond to their environment, adapt to stimuli, and even exhibit 'personalities' based on their respective abilities and preferences."
