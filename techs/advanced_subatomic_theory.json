    "description": "Discoveries in High Energy Chemistry (C2) point the way to a new Advanced Subatomic Theory that tries to detect and quantify the smallest possible underlying particles of matter. Using self-modifying Polymorphic Software (D2), the physicists developing this theory give mankind a window on the infinitesimal building blocks of the universe."
