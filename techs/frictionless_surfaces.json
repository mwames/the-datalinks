    "description": "Discovery of the Unified Field Theory (C7) allowed scientists to alter the fundamental properties of matter itself. The discovery of Frictionless Surfaces proves the most useful application of these techniques. As the name implies, Frictionless Surfaces consist of materials that remain unaffected by friction, a force that slows down motion by changing kinetic energy into heat energy. Moving objects made of these materials do not slow down as they come into contact with other matter."
