    "description": "Following the advent of Digital Sentience (D10), computers have only one great leap left: the evolution to Self-Aware Machines. Advances in N-Spce Compression (D11) provide the storage capacity needed for this technology. These machines are capable of complex, higher-order thinking, and value the experiences of existence as much as any biological being.  As with other living organisms, self-preservation is paramount for these specimens."
