    "description": "Eudaimonia is a philosophical system that takes its name from the ancient Greek word for fulfillment and happiness. Based on economic equity made possible by Sentient Econometrics (E11) and rooted in opposition to the excesses of The Will to Power (E8), Eudaimonia encourages each citizen to achieve happiness through striving to fulfill completely his or her potential; freedom, creativity, and individuality flourish in governments that adopt this philosophy."
