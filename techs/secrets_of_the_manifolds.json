After much training, I could see -- the very surface under our feet, Planet itself -- is a living, fluctuating nexus of energy, violent, beautiful and quite unstable.

Discovery of the Secrets of the Manifolds allows the perception and contact of these other Planetary Manifolds. This technology is based on an understanding of Sentient Resonance (C9) and Secrets of Alpha Centauri (D12)."
