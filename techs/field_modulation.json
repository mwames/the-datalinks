This sensitivity creates entirely new worlds of artistic endeavors for the race-or it may be developed into a powerful combat awareness that can foil any attempts at surprise.",

Built on an understanding of Progenitor Psych (E1) and Centauri Ecology (E1), the discovery of Field Modulation allows trained and equipped individuals to detect and perform basic manipulations of these 'resonance fields'."
