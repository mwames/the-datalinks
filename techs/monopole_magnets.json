    "description": "Magnetism, like electricity and gravity, is one of the fundamental forces of the universe. Prior to research in Superstring Theory (C5) and Silksteel Alloys (E4), all known magnets were dipolar, with a north and south pole. Development of a Monopole Magnet permits radical new applications for science and industry."
