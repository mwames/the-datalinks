    "description": "Quantum Machinery (B12) and Mind/Machine Interface (C6) pave the way for an understanding of gravity - the weakest fundamental force in the universe, but one that acts at infinite distances. With Graviton Theory, physicists can detect and measure the long-predicted gravitons - prticle strings that 'carry' gravitational force."
