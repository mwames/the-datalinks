    "description": "The power requirements of Optical Computers (D3) and the nascent Industrial Base (B1) stimulate research into high-temperature Superconductors, an advance long considered the 'holy Grail' by physical chemists. A Superconductor is a material that does not resist a flow of electrons. Using a Superconductor, power can be transmitted at incredible speeds over vast distances with no degredation. Bulky and expensive cooling equipment for high-powered machinery or weaponry becomes unnecessary, because these materials remain cool and efficient as electricity passes through them."
