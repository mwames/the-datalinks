    "description": "Earth scientist Max Planck first coined the term \"quantum\" to describe an individual particle of light. Planck thought each quantum was indivisible, so that a fraction of a quantum could not exist. One of the more startling discoveries arising from Unified Field Theory (C7) was that individual quantum actually could be split into component sub-particles, much like atoms may be split through fission. The energy released by Quantum Power is sever orders of magnitude greater than ordinary Fusion Power."
