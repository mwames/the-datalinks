    "description": "Knowledge of The Secrets of Creation (D11) paved the way for understanding Singularity Mechanics. This technology seeks the physical causes and composition of black holes - phenomena produced by points of infinitely dense matter that warp the fabric of space and time itself. Probes guided by onboard Self-Aware Machines (B11) transmit the data necessary to replicate this natural occurrence in controlled laboratory conditions."
