    "description": "Physicists had puzzled over the mystery of light for centureis: Why does light exhibit properties characteristic of both a wave and a particle? In 1924, Prince Louis-Victor Broglie, a French scientist, proved that all particles actually possess a wave aspect, which explained how light can act as a wave even though it does consist of particles, called photons. Following breakthroughs in Silksteel Alloys (E4) and Applied Relativity (D5), subsequent scientific inquiry focuses on the manipulation of Photon/Wave Mechanics so that light, even powerful laser beams or intense solar emissions, can be diffused and warped as needed."
