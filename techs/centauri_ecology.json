    "description": "Finding adequate sources of nutrients, energy and minerals is the most immediate problem facing the colonists after Planetfall. An understanding of the basics of Centauri Ecology provides the new arrivals with the tools they need to begin shaping the world around them - how plants grow, what geological structures exist, and how natural energy sources may be exploited on Planet."
